The last 5 presidents in our speeches collection were reagan, bush, clinton, gwbush and obama (that's how the tar.gz files of their speeches are named in Canvas).

Pairwise comparisons of the similarities in their speech collections (10 pairs) will give us a half-matrix like shown below (The symmetry in the problem formulation makes it unnecessary to compute the blank spots in the matrix):

         r b c g o
reagan     * * * *
bush         * * *
clinton        * *
gwbush           *
Compute the similarity denoted by each asterisk and answer:

Using n-gram character shingles, assuming n=4, which two presidents' speeches were the most similar and which were the least similar?
Using n-gram character shingles, assuming n=7, which two presidents' speeches were the most similar and which were the least similar?
Using n-gram word shingles, assuming n=2, which two presidents' speeches were the most similar and which were the least similar?
Using n-gram word shingles, assuming n=3, which two presidents' speeches were the most similar and which were the least similar?
